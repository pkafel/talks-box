                author: "Ben Christensen",
                description: "This talk will leverage the experience of introducing reactive programming into existing imperative, blocking codebases to demonstrate how it can be done and when it can make sense to do so. Not all benefits of reactive programming can be obtained without a greenfield, fully async architecture, but many can. Subjects to be covered will include the mental shift from imperative to declarative, working with blocking IO such as JDBC and RPC, service composition, debugging and unit testing.",

                author: "Martin Fowler",
                description: "Martin gives a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency. From this he outlines what kinds of circumstances you should consider using them, why they will not make relational databases obsolete, and the important consequence of polyglot persistence.",

It can quickly be used to great effect, but a deeper understand of its internals will prevent running into pitfalls later on. This talk will focus on the core mechanism of how streams are created and observed: subscribers and subscriptions.",

On July 20, 1969 millions of people had one of those transforming experiences: Two men landed on the Moon and nothing was ever the same again. Why did we go to the Moon? How did we get there? What was it like to witness it all? And what does any of this have to do with writing software 40 years later?",

As the world looked on horrified, few realised that this was an inevitable accident that had been predicted by the designers for years. Indeed, the day before the key engineers believed that there was \"essentially a 100% probability of disaster\".",

You've probably heard others on your team talking about components, services and layers rather than objects when they're having discussions. Take a look at the codebase though. Can you clearly see these abstractions or does the code reflect some other structure?",
