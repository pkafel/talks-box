            <p>Are you a software developer and you want to be up-to-date ? You missed your favorite conference and you want to watch the best talks from it ? Or are you just learning new stuff and searching for source of information ? <b>TalksBox is exactly for you !</b></p>
            <p>TalksBox is a service that is gathering talks about software development from many different events from the whole world. Our TalksBox comitee each month is selecting highly valuable and educaition-focuesed talks that will appear on our site. We are aware that there is a lot of great talks out there and it is really hard to gather them all in one place but we are doing our best.</p> 
            <p>We are <b>not limiting ourselfs to any particular technology or topics</b> as long as they are related to software development. It doesnt matter for us if talk is presented by well established speaker or new kid on the blocks - if your talk brings something to the table it will find a way to our service.</p>

            <h2>How do we pick talks ?</h2>
            <p>Currently all the talks are picked by a single person however we are working on it. We are aiming to have a comitee that will be responsible for bringing each month new talks and let users vote for ones that they enjoy the most. As a result we will have completely comunity driven service which everyone can ejoy !</p> 
            <p>When evaluating a talk we are using three main factors:
            <ul>
                <li>We all watch presentations or participate in conferences because we want to learn. As a software developers being up-to-date is one of the most important things. Because of that <b>educational value</b> is the most important factor for us.</li>
                <li>It is very important for us to have a talks where really <b>complex concepts are explained in an easy way</b>. In order to achive that the speaker needs to have not only knowledge but also skills that will let him to present it in an easy and approachable way.</li>
                <li>It is always easier to adopt knowledge when it is fun. Because of that we focus as well on <b>entertaining side of a talk</b>. What can be better than having some laugh and learning new things in the same moment ?</p></li>
            </ul> 
            <p>The higher all the factors are the bigger is a chance that the talk will make it to our service. Of course it is not always possible to have talks that are combaining all three mentioned factors and it would be silly of us if we would reject really good talk just because it is not entertaining enough. In the end is always about common sense and thats what we are trying use when selecting talks.</p>
