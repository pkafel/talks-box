            <p>Are you a software developer and you want to be up-to-date? You've missed your favorite conference and you want to watch the best talks from it? Or are you just learning new stuff and searching for a new source of information? <b>TalksBox is exactly for You!</b></p>
            <p>TalksBox is a service that is gathering talks about software development from many different events from all around the world. Each month our TalksBox comitee is selecting highly valuable and education-focused talks that will appear on our site. We are aware that there is a lot of great talks out there and it is really hard to gather them all in one place but we are doing our best.</p>
            <p>We are <b>not limiting ourselves to any particular technology or topics</b> as long as they are related to software development. It doesn't matter to us if talk is presented by well established speaker or new kid on the block - if your talk brings something to the table it will find a way to our service.</p>

            <h2>How do we pick talks?</h2>
            <p>Currently all the talks are picked by a single person however we are working on it. We are aiming to have a comitee that will be responsible for bringing each month new talks and let users vote for ones that they enjoy the most. As a result we will have completely community driven service which everyone can enjoy!</p>
            <p>We focus on three main factors when evaluating a talk:
            <ul>
                <li>We all watch presentations or participate in conferences because we want to learn. As a software developers being up-to-date is one of the most important things. Because of that <b>educational value</b> is the most important factor for us.</li>
                <li>It is very important for us to have talks where really <b>complex concepts are explained in a easy way</b>. In order to achive that the speaker needs to have, not only knowledge, but also skills that will let him present in an easily understandable way.</li>
                <li>It is always easier to adopt knowledge when it is fun. Because of that we focus on the <b>entertaining side of a talk</b>. What can be better than having some laugh while learning new things?</p></li>
            </ul> 
            <p>The higher all the factors are the bigger is a chance that the talk will make it to our service. Of course it is not always possible to have talks that are combining all three mentioned factors and it would be silly of us if we would reject really good talk just because it is not entertaining enough. In the end it is always about common sense and that's what we are trying to use when selecting talks.</p>
